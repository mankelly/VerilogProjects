# Simple Processor
### THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT!
### Please refer to my [8-bit](https://github.com/mankelly/VerilogProjects/tree/master/8-bit%20CPU) and 16-bit CPU's for a more correct architecture.

- This project was created when I had little knowledge on computer architecture.
- Some modules are not included as I cannot find my old project.
- CPU architecture is messy and at some parts incorrect, but I wanted to keep this as it is my first CPU project.
